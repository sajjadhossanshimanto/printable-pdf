This is a personal project and
the main objective of this project was to convert my fantasy class note to a printable format
- First thing it does -> removes any kind of colored backgroud other than text <img src="resource/ideal gas 43 raw.png"> <img src="resource/ideal gas 44 raw.png">
- also coverts it in a black & white form (to save printing cost ðŸ˜“)
- The 2nd and most important thing it does -> class slide ratio is inappropriate for print for paper. so it  college 3 slides in one & reshapes making them appropriate for A4 size 
<img src="resource/3 in 1 slide.jpg" height="50%" width="50%">
- In this way, we can print 12 slides on a single page!
